<b>[Happy 11/11 Initial Commit]</b> Excluding the Queries folder, because there's no free lunch.
<br />
<b>[12/11 Commit]</b> Attributes added; output to Json done.
<br />
<b>[13/11 Commit]</b> Markdown generator added, with examples. See [Output Folder](https://github.com/margohpolo/DataPOC/tree/main/DataPOC/Output) for both MD & Json examples.
<br />
<b>[15/11 Commit]</b> Added Excel output functionality ([Output](https://github.com/margohpolo/DataPOC/tree/main/DataPOC/Output) Example included).
<br />
<b>[15/11 Commit]</b> Cleaned up the entry point into a clean class, for better usability.
- Also noticed a significant performace boost, but unsure if it is from the refactor, or from clean-up of local C-drive.
